    <h1>The Princess Bellace Series</h1>
    <p>
      Each episode has its own title on a Princess Bellace episode with amount
      of running time. In 2025, due to the Princess Bellace Series, I have made
      it more powerful. I have started animating since February 7th 2025.

      <h1>Why building a character?</h1>
      <p>
        I’m working on my progress right now. I started building the shirt and
        the clothes for my character. All of the characters are by other people,
        I managed to choose blue since it’s my favorite color. During the
        extension, I wasn’t the only one to make an unofficial series, I upload
        some of them to YouTube and each episode releases its own animation, I
        somehow decided to do every animation all time and see how that goes,
        it’ll turn out incredibly perfect, for 100% sure. Following the story, I
        grouped them into seasons and each TPBL and SSB episode has its own
        episode during the story.
      </p>
      <p>These characters must be based on Tenki Soft</p>
      <h3>The money system</h3>
      <p>
        By continuing the trend by using kali, meji, giji, asto, luno, fermo,
        jovo, solo, beto, and gloco. The ones less than a pyrillion are invented
        by Jonathan Bowers by use the money prefix system. By going past
        multillion? I invented some names to match with the money prefix system.
        Those were founded on the Jonathan Bowers's polytope and illions site.

      <h3>For SI Prefixes:</h3>
      <img
        src="2019-Measurement-Is-About-Purpose-blog-image.webp"
        width="500" />
      <p>
        <b>Recalling</b> that decisions were made at previous meetings when it
        was considered timely to extend the range of SI prefixes including
        Resolution 12 (paragraph 3) adopted by the CGPM at its 11th meeting
        (1960), Resolution 8 adopted by the CGPM at its 12th meeting (1964),
        Resolution 10 adopted by the CGPM at its 15th meeting (1975), Resolution
        4 adopted by the CGPM at its 19th meeting (1991), and Resolution 3
        adopted by the CGPM at its 27th meeting (2022),
      </p>
      <p><b>Considering</b></p>
      <li>
        The essential role of the International System of Units (SI) in
        providing confidence in the accuracy and global comparability of
        measurements needed for international trade, manufacturing, human health
        and safety, protection of the environment, global climate studies and
        scientific research,
      </li>
      <li>
        The benefits of encouraging the use of SI units by providing new SI
        prefixes for scientific communities that depend on measurements that are
        not covered by the current range,
      </li>
      <li>
        The needs of data science in the near future to express quantities of
        digital information using orders of magnitude in excess of
        10<sup>30</sup>,
      </li>
      <li>
        The importance of timely action to prevent unofficial prefix names being
        <i>de facto</i> adopted in other communities,
      </li>
      <p>
        If the need to an expansion of the range of SI prefixes is agreed, some
        general principles for identifying the names and symbols of new SI
        prefixes may be considered:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The names should be simple and, if possible, meaningful and memorable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Letters already in use for SI Prefixes that may cause confusion must
          be permanently avoided.
        </li>
        <li>
          The names should have some connection to the powers of 10<sup>3</sup>
          that they represent.
        </li>
        <li>
          The names should be based on either Latin, Greek, or Femenian as the
          most used languages previously.
        </li>
        <li>Multiples should end ‘-a’ and sub-multiples should end ‘-o’.</li>
        <li>
          The symbols used should be the same letter for a given power of ten,
          in upper case for multiples and in lower case for sub-multiples.
        </li>
        <li>
          Following the precedent set recently, letters should be used in
          reverse English alphabetical order, suitably modifying chosen names,
          and skipping letters as appropriate.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>Decides</b> to add to the list of SI prefixes to be used for
        multiples and submultiples of units the following prefixes:
